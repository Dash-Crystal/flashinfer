# Mixed KV page transport: one backend per architecture

This document is normative for `csrc/xqa/` and `include/flashinfer/attention/` on the
mixed-KV-page branch. It exists because of the following review finding, quoted exactly:

> **sm90 ≠ sm120, and it keeps trying to unify them.** On sm120 `mma.sync` takes
> register operands and `cvt.rn.bf16x2.e2m1x2` is native → in-fragment decode is
> correct and *already works* (79.6 vs 120 µs). On sm90 `wgmma` reads smem for free
> and FP4 decode is software → expand-to-A16-smem in dedicated converter warps and
> leave the baseline SS-GMMA consumer byte-for-byte untouched. Its current RS-GMMA
> sm90 path puts ~14 instr/lane of shuffle+cvt+FMA in front of each ~8-cycle
> `m64n16k16` wgmma — the decode is 2–3× longer than the MMA it feeds, and the FP4
> arm of `loadMixedKTileFragment` **still reads smem byte-by-byte with the scalar x2
> cvt** despite the "official x8 substitution" claim (the x8 helper exists in
> `mhaUtils.cuh`; this path doesn't call it).

## Rule

Every CUDA compute capability that differs in any instruction used by the attention
prologue, mainloop, or epilogue is a **separate backend**. sm80, sm86, sm89, sm90,
sm100, sm103, sm120, and any later revision are distinct where their ISA, tensor-core
operand sourcing, copy engines, or conversion instructions differ. A kernel is shared
between two architectures only when the *identical* source compiles to the intended
instruction sequence on both; that is a property to be checked, not assumed.

Concretely, for this branch:

| Concern | sm90 (Hopper) | sm120 (Blackwell consumer) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MMA operand source | `wgmma` A from **smem** (SS) or registers (RS); B from smem | `mma.sync` A and B from **registers** |
| Bulk copy | TMA tensor maps (`cp.async.bulk.tensor`) — one elected lane per copy | `cp.async.bulk` (non-tensor) — one elected lane per copy |
| E4M3 → A16 | `cvt` via f16 pair | native packed `cvt.rn.bf16x2.e4m3x2` |
| E2M1 → A16 | **software** (`prmt` LUT, x8 per 32-bit word) | native `cvt.rn.bf16x2.e2m1x2` |
| Correct place to dequantize | dedicated converter warps → A16 smem stage → unchanged SS-GMMA consumer | inside the consumer's register-fragment load (the path that already wins) |
| Source file | `csrc/xqa/mha_sm90.cu` | `csrc/xqa/mha.cu` |
| Bandwidth-side reference in tree | `3rdparty/cutlass/.../sm90_mma_tma_gmma_rs_warpspecialized_mixed_input.hpp` | `include/flashinfer/attention/sparse_mla_sm120/decode_dsv4_kernel.cuh` |

The two right-hand columns are not converging. Do not port the sm120 register-fragment
decode into the sm90 GMMA consumer; do not port sm90 smem-expansion into sm120.
Shared code between the two is limited to: page-format metadata gather
(`gatherMixedPageFormats`), scale arithmetic (`scaleA16x2`), the conversion helpers in
`mhaUtils.cuh` that are themselves `__CUDA_ARCH__`-guarded, and the host API.

## Dispatch must be explicit and asserted

`flashinfer/jit/xqa.py` chooses which source enters the module. Which kernel executes
for a given (architecture, page format) pair is a fact the test suite must assert, not
infer from timings. Requirements:

1. Every JIT module exports the architecture it was compiled for and the kernel family
   (`mha_sm90` GMMA vs. architecture-neutral `mha`) it will launch; tests read this and
   fail if a measurement is attributed to the wrong kernel.
2. Excluding `mha_sm90.cu` for a format (as `jit/xqa.py` currently does for
   `block_scaled_fp8`) is a **dispatch decision** that must be visible in the module
   URI and in benchmark output. Silent fallback to `mha.cu` on an sm90 device is a
   failure, not a fallback.
3. A performance number for "sm90 FP8/FP4" is only admissible when the asserted kernel
   family is `mha_sm90`.

## What this rules out

- Any change to `mha_sm90.cu` motivated by an sm120 measurement, or vice versa.
- Any single "unified" mixed-input consumer that must be correct on both architectures.
- Any topology argument ("N load warps per operand", "converter warps in the consumer")
  that is not stated per architecture with the instruction it is balancing against.

## What this does not rule out

- Identical **host** APIs, page layouts, scale layouts, and `page_format` semantics
  across architectures. The storage contract in `include/flashinfer/attention/page_transport.cuh`
  is architecture-independent by design.
- Identical **acceptance tests**: bit-exactness against explicit A16 expansion, and the
  roofline targets in `mixed_kv_page_transport_cutlass_references.md`, apply to both.
